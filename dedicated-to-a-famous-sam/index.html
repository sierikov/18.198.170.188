<h1>Level 9</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Level 9!</h2>
<p>Until now, things were easy. Maybe too easy? Well, this is gonna change right now.</p>
<p>Call <a href="this-was-way-too-easy-until-now">this-was-way-too-easy-until-now</a> for something a little harder.</p>
<p>But just in case you are stuck now, rest assured:</p>
<p>Soon - after more unknown excitement - levels might offer rather simple explanations.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
